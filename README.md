In this assignment you are to create code to build a hashtable using information about students as input.  The goal is to learn how to set up a basic hash table, create a hash function, implement a collision handling strategy, and experiment with variations and note the impact they have on the resulting table. The assignment is therefore more like thesorting assignment and less about creating a lot of program code.
